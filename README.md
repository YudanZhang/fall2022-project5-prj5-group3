+ Project summary: Resume matching is pertty important in job searching. Our goal is to design an engine that could scan your resume and match the information in it to the jobs in the job boards, and recommend the most suitable job link for you to apply based on the similarity of the resume and job description. This project consists of 3 parts: Resume information extracting using PyPDF2.PdfFileReader package, Website information scrapping using BeautifulSoup package, and Information matching by calculating cosin similarity between two texts. At the end we are able to provide users with a list of jobs that are most recommended to them based on similarity score.
